# Project Background
According to Our World in Data, the Philippines over the past 3 decades had one of the highest emigration rates in Southeast Asia based on the growth rate of its diaspora population (i.e., the population born in the Philippines but have since moved out and live in another country). While not the highest in Southeast Asia, it is higher than the world average and the Asian average. (Keep in mind that the plot purposely excluded Myanmar, as the initial plot showed that its diaspora growth rate was disporportionately higher than the other entries, largely due to a major civil war and refugee crisis, two factors that are not as apparent in other Southeast Asian countries).

The comparatively high emigration rate begs the question of why? Of course, people have different reasons for leaving a country and/or wanting to move to a specific one, but the fact that

# Data Structure and Initial Checks

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: table1, table2, table3, table4, with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:

- **Table 3:**
- **Table 4:**
- **Table 5:**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

The following image below shows a static screenshot of the deployed dashboard, focusing in the four areas mentioned previously. What the Dashboard demonstrates is that the Philippines is not in a very good standing economically in comparison to other countries, particulalry its Southeast Asian neighbours. This reality has lead the Philippines to become the country with one of the highest emigration rates in Southeast Asia.

# Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we have established the following public policy recommendations that the Philippine government should, at the very least, consider: 

* The emigration rate for the Philippines remains comparatively high. **The Philippine government should discontinue the Labour Export Policy-a broad policy directive from the 1970s that establishes overseas work as a major economic plank, and thus entice people to leave the country in the thousands each day-and focus their efforts on intense national industrialization in order to create many well-paying jobs domectially.**
  
* Extreme poverty rates may be going down, but many other countries have been more successful in rapidly decreasing it. **Economic policies that enhance the living conditions of the working class-e.g., living wages that are never below inflation, funnelling spending towards decreasing the costs of important services such as healthcare-must be the direction that the government must take over austerity.**
  
* The gaps between minimum wage and the calculated family living wage vary widely across each regions-Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, in particular, being a huge outlier with an exceptionally high wage gap-and are directly tied to the economic policies from the Martial Law era (1970s-1980s). **Ensuring that the minimum wage for each region, at the very least, matches with the calculated family living wage, should be a priority for all levels of government, and should be seen as part of an omnibus effort to rectify the economic fallout from the Martial Law era.**
  
* When considering Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index, GDP per-capita, and the Gini Coefficient, the Philippines appear to be in the middle of the pack of Southeast Asian countries. **Therefore, all levels of government must focus on passing laws that emphasizes economic development for all regions and economic standing for all sectors of Philippine society (e.g., fisherfolks, peasants, urban poor, students).**
  
* The Philippines continues to face incredibly high inflation rates across all indices, not just in absolute terms but also in relative terms. **Any future measures taken to mitigate inflation must ensure that prices for consumers remain reasonable and affordable.**
  


# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Data was missing for certain metrics and certain countries. Therefore, it was not always feasible to ascertain the full picture with regards to the socioeconomic realities of each country.
  
* The Dashboard compared the Philippines' socioeconomic standings with the rest of Southeast Asia, for the most part. However, the shared geography (and, in a few cases, some overlaps with regards to cultural similarities) does not mean that the comparison will be perfect. Each country have their own unique histories (albeit, there may be some commonalities), demographic outlook, public policy direction, economies, policital systems, available resources, diplomatic networks, etc. Better comparisons may exist between the Philippines and other countries.

* Additionally, this should not be interpreted as endorsing the economic and public policy direction of the countries mentioned. They also have some work to do in terms of addressing economic inequalities and other factors that are pushing people to leave their respective countries (in some cases, at higher rates than the Philippines itself).

* Nor should this project be interpreted as an endorsement of the economic metric used in this project (e.g., the Gini Coefficient, the IHDI). These measures were selected to help give a better understanding of the Philippines' socioeconomic standing in comparison to other countries, but more comprehensive socioeconomic analysis should not simply use economic indices without having some critique and analysis of their methodologies.
